# Why?

Because I mess up my OS every so often. So here are some things I maybe should remember every time I start over.

I'm gonna update this repo every time I discovered a new cool thing.

# Fedora 39:

Navigate between windows:

1) Go to settings
2) Go to keyboard
3) Go to shortcuts
4) Go to navigation
5) set "switch windows" with "alt + tab"
